Here is the task list that you should run when setting up the repository/workspace.

Begin by profiling the environments.

The profile should note:

- The machines' purpose (the desktop is the user's primary workstation, the laptop is used for travel much less frequently and is less updated and less powerful)
- The current OS 
- The hardware: note the available RAM, GPU, CPU, and any other relevant details 

Given that the user uses local AI it's also important to take careful note of the GPU and any additional utilities installed. This information should be noted so that when updating the remote, we don't install things that the remote cannot support.
